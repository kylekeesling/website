Abstraction languages ([Jade][jade-link], [HAML][haml-link], [SASS][sass-link], [LESS][less-link], [CoffeeScript][coffee-link]) have been around for awhile but it seems that the idea has grown in popularity over the last year or two. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it does raise an interesting question: *Why* ?

It's at least partially due to the pace at which development and technology move versus the snail's pace at which web standards move, but part of me worries that it could quickly become a situation where developers use it as a crutch.

On the other hand I do see some of its merits. I'm personally a fan of CSS and JavaScript abstraction since these areas can be cumbersome and repetitive, but HTML abstraction seems a bit moot.
