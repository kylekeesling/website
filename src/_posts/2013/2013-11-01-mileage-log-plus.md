On the latest [CMD+Space][podcastLink] Myke interviews David Barnard of [Contrast][contrastLink] (formerly App Cubby). It's an interesting discussion regarding some of the realities of what being an app developer is like, and sheds some light on what being on the top selling and grossing lists in the App Store really means. In addition to his thoughts of the App Store I also learned about one of his newest apps called [Mileage Log+][productLink].

Mileage Log+ a handy little app that allows you to easily log and report on mileage you accrue for work purposes. I downloaded it last night and started to enter all of my weekly drives between Indy and Muncie. It's a simple interface that allows you to quickly enter all necessary details, and even save certain trips as templates so you can quickly enter them again in the future. It also allows you to backup all of the app's data to a Dropbox folder, making it simple to grab the data later without reaching for your phone.

Some people may scoff at the $9.99 price tag but think about this: after logging just one round trip for my work I'm able to write off enough money to buy the app five times over. The app essentially pays for itself!

If you log a lot of miles for work then I highly recommend picking it up, it's worth well more than what it's priced at.
