I recently started listening to a newer podcast on [esn.fm][esn] called [Fire Talk with Me][link]. It's a limited edition show that runs through each episode of David Lynch's masterpiece Twin Peaks, and gives the perspectives of one person who experienced the show during its inital run, [Jeremy Smith][jeremy], and one who's experiencing it for the first time, [Allie Goertz][allie]. They have guests on along the way, but are very good about not spoiling anything for Allie. They have currently covered the pilot and the first four episodes, releasing a new one each week.

Whether you are a total Lynch fanatic, or know nothing about Twin Peaks, this is a great podcast to supplement your viewing experience, which can stream in its entirety on Netflix, or splurge for the Blu-Ray set, complete with the prequel movie, Fire Walk with Me.

Either way I can't recommend you watch this enough. It gives you a lot of perspective as to what shaped some of the ideas/styles of some of today's best television shows.
