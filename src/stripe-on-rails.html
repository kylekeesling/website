<h2>About the Course</h2>

<p>Stripe helps to make collecting online payments much easier, and while their docs are great, it can still be a
  daunting task, but this course is designed to fill in the gaps and make your app ready for prime time.
</p>
<p>
  We'll accomplish this by starting with a fresh Rails app and adding all of the necessary dependencies and logic
  necessary to fully integrate it with Stripe, allowing users to purchase both one-time products as well as on-going
  invoices.

</p>
<p>
  I'll explain scenarios where you might be able to leverage some of the great no-code/low-code options Stripe has to
  offer, like <a target="_blank" href="https://stripe.com/docs/payments/elements">Stripe Elements</a> and
  <a target="_blank" href="https://stripe.com/docs/payments/checkout">Stripe Checkout</a>, as well as how to build
  deeper, custom integrations when they are
  called for.
</p>
<p>
  We'll also cover things like how to accept and process the various <a target="_blank"
     href="https://stripe.com/docs/webhooks">webhooks</a> Stripe provides, without using any
  third-party libraries!

</p>
<p>We'll answer questions like:</p>
<ul>
  <li>What's the difference between Charges and Invoices?</li>
  <li>Should I use Products and Prices?</li>
  <li>How can I safely store and re-use payment methods?</li>
  <li>How can I create payment flows that allow both subscriptions as well as one-time payments?</li>
  <li>How can I offer customers the ability to create invoices as well as require others to pay immediately?</li>
  <li>In addition all of my examples will use the following versions:</li>
  <li><a target="_blank" href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2021/12/25/ruby-3-1-0-released/">Ruby 3.1</a></li>
  <li>
    <a target="_blank" href="https://api.rubyonrails.org/v7.0.1/">Rails 7</a>,
    including <a target="_blank" href="https://turbo.hotwired.dev/">Turbo</a> and <a target="_blank"
       href="https://stimulus.hotwired.dev/">Stimulus</a>
  </li>
  <li><a target="_blank" href="https://stripe.com/docs/upgrades#2020-08-27">Stripe API version 2020-08-27</a></li>
</ul>

      <p>ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Kyle Keesling. I've been a Ruby on Rails developer since 2008. I helped start a software company
        called PASS where I've designed and built both of our software products.</p>
      <p>Being my company's only programmer I've always wanted to come up with a good way to share what I've learned
        with others, so I hope you find my courses interesting and helpful!</p>

<h2>My Qualifications</h2>

<p>I am co-founder and CTO of <a target="_blank" href="https://passtesting.com/">PASS Training & Compliance</a>, a
  provider of cloud-based tools specifically designed for the
  unique environmental compliance needs of underground fuel storage tanks (USTs). Over the years our company has
  developed
  two products, the PASS Training LMS, and PASS Tools, a compliance and regulatory management platform.
</p>
<p>
  I am and have always been the sole developer for our company and have been maintaining Ruby on Rails apps in
  production
  continually for over 10 years. I've leveraged Stripe in both of our offerings for nearly that long as well. The
  payment
  systems in these apps are responsible for collecting hundreds of thousands of dollars annually using both one-time
  payments as well as recurring subscriptions.
