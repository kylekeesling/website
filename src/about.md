# ðŸ‘‹ Hi There

I'm Kyle Keesling. I've been a Ruby on Rails developer since 2008. I helped start a software company called PASS where I've designed and built both of our software products.

Being my company's only programmer I've always wanted to come up with a good way to share what I've learned with others, so I hope you find my articles and courses interesting and helpful!
